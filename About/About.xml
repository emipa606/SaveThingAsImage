I was creating a preview image for a mod and got frustrated that even with the games texture sources downloaded I could not really capture the specific texture I wanted. Pawns, items and buildings can have dynamic colors and shadows in game compared to the source textures.

So I made this mod, it adds a new debug-action called "Save Thing as image".
When used you can click on any Thing in game and it will export the graphic as seen in game to a png.
Hopefully someone more than me can get use of it!
