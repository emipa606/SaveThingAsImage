I was creating a preview image for a mod and got frustrated that even with the games texture sources downloaded I could not really capture the specific texture I wanted. Pawns, items and buildings can have dynamic colors and shadows in game compared to the source textures.

So I made this mod, it adds a new debug-action called "Save Thing as image".
When used you can click on any Thing in game and it will export the graphic as seen in game.

Hopefully someone more than me can get use of it!
